# Colour-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning
Colour detection system is the program for detecting the name of any color by clicking on a particular image which will read the pixel color by matching from the dataset provided in excel file.
I have mapped certain lights with their color names. I will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
I will be using pandas and numpy python packages in this Project to help us read and work on the dataset which will be in the .csv format.
I will be using setMouseCallback function to select pixels from an image and further perform work on it.
The image which we will use to identify colors will be in the .jpg format.
Colors value are within a range of 0 to 255. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In a  dataset, we need to map each colorâ€™s values with their corresponding names. But I will be using a dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names.
